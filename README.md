# Snake game on PyGame 

A simple snake game on Pygame. 
I made it primary as a language translation project, it's based on [the tutorial for JavaScript learners](https://youtu.be/9TcU2C1AACw ), but rewrittten entirely in Python.

## How to play

Well, it's a snake game, you know.
But if you don't, the point is to collect fruit to grow your snake, but do not bump into the walls or itself. Use WASD to get your snake moving in the right direction and do not try to plainly reverse it, that would not work.
The game strats either by running main.py with python3, or making it executable to run.

## Requirements

- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)

## Known issues 

- The fruit renders glitchy
- The snake can be spawned near a wall 
- The snake's initial location is not visually distinct enough
- The game doesn't even try to give the player a tutorial
